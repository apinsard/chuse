"""chuse is a utility for Portage package manager (namely Gentoo Linux base systems). It enables you
to edit USE flags for a particular ebuild. It is based on emod (https://github.com/Pyntony/emod), a
tool I started to develop for the same purpose but that I never ended.

"emod" was originally developped to avoid forgetting a ">" when running "echo app-dummy/example -qt
gtk >> /etc/portage/package.use" for instance and the overwrite the file. 

I decided to start over because I want this tool to be as much simple as possible. "emod" handles
package.{accept_keywords,env,keywords,license,mask,properties,unmask,use}. Basically this tool will
only be useful for package.use. Other files are rarely modified, and editing them manually would
probably do the job quite good enough.

Usage:
    chuse <atom> [<modifier><flag> ...] [--because <reason>]

    atom:
        [version-selector]<ebuild-cat>/<ebuild-pkg>[-<version>]
        Obviously 'version-selector' and 'version' should never be set without the other.
    version-selector:
        One of : "=", ">", "<", ">=", "<=".
    ebuild-cat:
        An ebuild category (validity won't be checked).
    ebuild-pkg:
        An ebuild package (validity won't be checked).
    version:
        A version of the underlying package (validity won't be checked).
    modifier:
        One of : "-", "+", "%" (% means reset default).
    flag:
        A USE flag (validity won't be checked).
    reason:
        The reason why you changed these USE flags (so that you remember why you set this and if now
        you can reset default for instance).
