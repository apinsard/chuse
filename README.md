Chuse
=====

Chuse stands for CHange USE. This is a Portage tool for managing your local USE flags (ie. set
within `/etc/portage/package.use`).

In contrast to its several equivalents, it is designed with a very specific goal: Make your
`/etc/portage/package.use` management easier. This means `chuse` does not handle other `package.*`
and **focuses** on `package.use`. Indeed, I think you often have to deal with `package.use` and need
a clean structure. On the other hand, you rarely have more than 10 lines in your `package.mask`,
`package.keywords`... and open underlying files to read or edit them just work fine.

Installation
------------

Chuse is available from the [sapher overlay][1]. It is also available in the main Funtoo tree.

Once you have added this overlay, just emerge `chuse`.

    # emerge -av chuse

By default, `chuse` uses the following hierarchy pattern:

    /etc/portage/package.use/<cat-name>/<pkg-name>

This file would contain each rules for the package <pkg-name> in the category <cat-name>.

### If you don't use this hierarchy pattern

#### If you want to use your own current pattern

You can toggle this default pattern by explicitely setting the PACKAGE\_USE\_FILE\_PATTERN
environment variable (eg. in your bashrc).

PACKAGE\_USE\_FILE\_PATTERN examples:

    PACKAGE_USE_FILE_PATTERN="/etc/portage/package.use" # All in one file
    PACKAGE_USE_FILE_PATTERN="/etc/portage/package.use/%(cat)s" # One file per category
    PACKAGE_USE_FILE_PATTERN="/etc/portage/package.use/%(cat)s/%(pkg)s" # This is the default
    PACKAGE_USE_FILE_PATTERN="/etc/portage/package.use/chuse" # One file dedicated to chuse

`%(cat)s` and `%(pkg)s` would be respectively replaced by the category name and the package name of
the atom you want to alter USE flags.

#### If you want to adopt this hierarchy pattern

You will have to backup your current USE flags in a file and reorganize the package.use hierarchy.
To achieve this, issue the following commands:

    # chuse --dump > /root/package.use.bak # Concat all your rules in one file
    # chuse --load /root/package.use.bak # Export the backup to the new hierarchy

To avoid mistakes, `chuse --load` will ask you before erasing `/etc/portage/package.use`.

Usage
-----

    chuse [-f|--force] <atom> [[modifier]<flag> ...] [--because <reason>]
        Alter use flags. By default, if the given atom doesn't match any existing ebuild,
        an error will be raised. Use -f/--force option to disable this behavior.  If no flag
        is specified, the current rules matching the underlying atom will be displayed.
    chuse <atom>
        Print current flags set and history.
    chuse (-h|--help)
        Print this help.chuse (-v|--version)
        Print version information.
    chuse --dump
        Print all contents of /etc/portage/package.use
    chuse --load <file>
        Load a backup file to the /etc/portage/package.use hierarchy.

    atom:
        A valid package atom.
    modifier:
        One of: +, -, %. (% means reset default). If omitted, + is assumed.
    flag:
        A USE flag (validity won't be checked).
    reason:
        The reason why you changed these US flags (so that you remember why you set this
        and if you can reset default in the future for instance.

Examples
--------

Add system-cairo, remove system-icu and reset system-jpeg for firefox >= 37.0.1:

    $ sudo chuse ">=www-client/firefox-37.0.1" +system-cairo -system-icu %system-jpeg

Add offensive for sudo:

    $ sudo chuse app-admin/sudo offensive --because much cooler

Show the flags you altered for sudo:

    $ chuse app-admin/sudo
    # [2015-04-18T11:54] Unset sendmail
    # [2015-04-18T11:56] Set offensive
    # much cooler
    app-admin/sudo offensive -sendmail

You can omit the package category:

    $ sudo chuse qtile +dbus
    $ chuse '=qtile-0.10.6'
    # [2017-01-12T07:34] Set dbus
    x11-wm/qtile dbus

Obviously this won't work if the package name is ambiguous:

    $ chuse screen
    Error: This atom is ambiguous, please specify the package category

As well, the existence of ebuilds matching the atom is checked. You can use
the --force (shortly -f) option to disable this behavior:

    $ sudo chuse unexisting/package +foo -bar
    Error: This atom does not match any existing ebuild. Use --force option
    to proceed anyway
    $ sudo chuse -f unexisting/package +foo -bar
